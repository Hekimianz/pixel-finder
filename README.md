# Retro Finder

This is a game like "Where's Waldo?", which challenges players to find a character hidden within a busy and detailed scene.

This project serves as a way to practice using React, React Routing and also to implement a backend with Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
